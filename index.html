        Brief subject description
        Online presence is a part of every day life. Web content needs to be delivered to various devices and needs
        to be available and accessible at all times. There are many technologies involved and these change rapidly.
        This subject will introduce students to the core technologies involved in delivering web content. Students will
        have an opportunity to build a simple web site and learn about techniques and strategies for maintaining web
        presence. The subject will also teach students how to evaluate and select web technologies and how to stay
        up to date with relevant trends and standards. The main focus will be on front-end, but students will be
        introduced to all components of the full-stack. Practical components will focus on the most widely deployed
        technologies to equip students with skills that are immediately applicable in the real-world and in demand by
        employers.
