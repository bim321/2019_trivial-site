        <h2>Part A – Create Basic Website</h2>
        <p>
            Each student will create a website with several web pages that use HTML5, CSS3 and
            images. Students are expected to implement fully functional navigation between the pages.
            You will need to create a website to show case your abilities – an online portfolio of your
            work. The website should consist of several pages with properly implemented navigation
            between them. At a minimum, your website should consist of at least three web pages. You
            are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience.
            When designing and implementing the website, you need to keep the following
            requirements in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight
                your talents and abilities.</li>
            <li>Project a professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or
                recruitment agents.</li>
            <li>Provide a method for interested parties to contact you.</li>
            <li>Your website should work well on a desktop computer with Firefox and Chrome.</li>
        </ul>
